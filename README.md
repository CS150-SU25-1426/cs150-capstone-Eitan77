Part 1 Journal:

Resources: What out-of-class resources were used in the development process? Cite any AI used, as well as code reference websites.

    I didn't really use any out-of-class rescources for this assignment becuase it was all very similar to the assignments we have done before. I did use ChatGPT to 
    help me figure out a problem with declaring strings in the .h file becuase I forgot to add the "using namespace std" line. I also used ChatGPT to help 
    me figure out how to acess the .h file in the .cpp file, which I did not know how to do before. 

Optional: A summary of what when well, and what could have gone smoother. What parts were challenging? What parts were unable to be finished on time?

    Overall it went pretty well, not much was challenging for this part. I had not worked with the two seperate .h and .cpp files before though, so I had to figure that out. 
    Was able to finish on time, and will get started on part 2.

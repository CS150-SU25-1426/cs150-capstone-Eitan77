Part 2 Journal:

Resources: What out-of-class resources were used in the development process? Cite any AI used, as well as code reference websites.

    I mainly used the Surfboard assignment to do this part, and ChatGPT to help me figure out that it was the getLine function that I was missing. 

Optional: A summary of what when well, and what could have gone smoother. What parts were challenging? What parts were unable to be finished on time?

    The project went really well, it did take me a bit to figure out how to do all of the different files and have them integrate with eachother, but once I got them all linked and understood the instructions it was smooth.
